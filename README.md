# portability-libs

This directory contains two libraries relating to Erlang performance
portability:

* `attr`: code for equipping Elrang nodes with attributes which can then be used by 
other nodes as a basis for deciding where to spawn processes.

* `dist`: code for an abstract model of communication distances.  This will appear shortly.
